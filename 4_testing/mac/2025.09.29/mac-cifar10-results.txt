Training dataset: CIFAR-10 (data_batch_1.bin, data_batch_2.bin, data_batch_3.bin, data_batch_4.bin, and data_batch_5.bin; each containing 10000 images)
Testing dataset:  CIFAR-10 (test_batch.bin containing 10000 images)
Dataset information: The CIFAR-10 dataset consists of 60000 32x32 colour images in 10 classes, with 6000 images per class. There are 50000 training images and 10000 test images. The dataset is divided into five training batches and one test batch, each with 10000 images. The test batch contains exactly 1000 randomly-selected images from each class.
